# Important Notes:
    
# Returns an Iterator:
# zip() returns an iterator, which means it doesnâ€™t produce the final result immediately. You need to convert it to a list or tuple 
# to view the output, like list(zip(...)).


# Memory Efficient:
# Since it returns an iterator, zip() is memory-efficient for large datasets.
